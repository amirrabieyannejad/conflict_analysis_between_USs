# Conflict Analysis
Our system initiates with backlogs annotated with [Doccano tool](https://github.com/ace-design/nlp-stories) generated by Mosser et al. as the primary input. These annotated USs are used to apply conflict analysis based on specific criteria. 

To conduct conflict analysis, a one-time preparatory phase is needed to categorize the verbs in USs of backlog into four categories. Once this is done, conflict analysis can be applied to the USs using these categories and specific criteria.

Once the conflict analysis has been applied, a comprehensive report is created that contains information regarding conflict pairs in both a textual and a tabular form.
Following Figure illustrates how each step in this sequence is interconnected, with the output of one step feeding directly into the next. This diagram effectively demonstrates the toolchain and process workflow, highlighting how each tool transforms artefacts and contributes to the overall objective of conflict detection.

## Gathering all Extracted report using VBa
In order to evalute the extracte reports from 19 datasets, we use a [VBa acript](https://github.com/amirrabieyannejad/conflict_analysis_between_USs/blob/main/00_annotated_datasets/extractFromJSONFiles_Version(new).xlsm) which read the extracted information from JSON-report and gather the information like `PID`, `conflict pair`, `Text of conflict pair`, `text of conflict pair in main part`, `affected resource(entity)`, `Conflict reason`, `affected resource in relation of contain entity`.
